Analytics- Apple Inc. 

The research question for our analytics project is will Apple sustain its iPhone’s success in competitive smartphone market. We believe that analytics could help us to find solution to this question.

We have collected data from different sources for Apple and its competitors which will be helpful to do this analysis and uploaded data on this repository in spreadsheet format. These data include worldwide smartphone unit sales by vendors and by regions, market shares, operating profits, average selling prices, revenue growth, sales growth in emerging market, sales by OS, number of apps and users for different OS, switching rates from android to iOS, competitors financial information, customer satisfaction and brand loyalty.

Ideas to find answer to this question by using Analytics:
1. Real competition- compare Samsung/other competing companies’ data to apple and also compare data with upcoming competitor with new business model Xiaomi – (to prove level of competition). The mid-range 4-inch iPhone SE released on March 22, 2016 could help Apple battle Xiaomi. Upcoming iPhone such as iPhone 7, upgrades could help apple to sustain its position in smartphone market for coming year (the number of people who had an iPhone prior to the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus announcements (in September of '14), that have not yet upgraded to a 6, 6 Plus, 6s, or 6s Plus is around 60 percent. So another way to think of that is, 40 percent have, 60 percent have not).
2. Use descriptive model to compare data and predictive model (forecasting) to predict unit sales for apple for upcoming years.
