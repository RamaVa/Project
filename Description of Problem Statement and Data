Problem Statement

Main problem Apple will start facing is iPhone sustainability in competitive smartphone market. Current Apple’s revenue is overly reliant on iPhone.  So future of apple depends heavily on the future of iPhones to drive its growth.  Generally trend observed in Apple’s or any other product line is product go through birth, growth and decline. This birth, growth and decline pattern happened with iPod and iPad. Will the same pattern be observed for Apple iPhone?

So another way to think of that is, 40 percent have, 60 percent have not).
